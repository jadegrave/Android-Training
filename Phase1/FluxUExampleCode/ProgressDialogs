ProgressDialogs are a specific type of dialog that show the user something is going on. It can block the UI and can show both determinate and indeterminate progress.

mProgressDialog = new ProgressDialog(getActivity());
mProgressDialog.setTitle(getString(R.string.progress_dialog_title));
mProgressDialog.setMessage(getString(R.string.progress_dialog_message));
You can perform actions such as dismiss(), cancel(), and setCancelable():

mProgressDialog.cancel();
mProgressDialog.show();
mProgressDialog.setCancelable(false);
